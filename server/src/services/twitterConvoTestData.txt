Hi Jai, seems like we have a bunch of mutuals here! I saw you responded to that toggl tweet by @silasalberti last year and that you listed rize in your daily drivers on your website. I'm working on a new ai-automated distraction and time tracking app. Would you be interested in trying it? Would love your feedback!

Hi Kyle, I miss chatting with you guys on airchat! inflight looks amazing! i think fast feedback loops in any kind of profession or experience are extremely valuable. Great to see you pushing the limits of that in design. Would love to catch up via a call sometime and hear how your idea exploration process was like and get your thoughts on a productivity/time/distraction tracker product I've been working on:)

Hi Eric, great chatting at the Alfred's/Florian's party! Would love an intro to Henrik Berggren (who's working on aritual ai which you told me about). I can send you a forwardable blurb if that helps.

Hey Max, I realized I don't really have a lot of time to read the magazine, but I'd love to listen to the audio version. There are various services through which you can pipe the text (http://wondercraft.ai is good) that will read it with respect to formatting/headers etc. and I think there are ways to paywall the podcast version as well... Since I am currently in between things and doing some contract work, I'd be happy to take this on as a project.

Hi Dan, as someone whose work and writing I admire, I wanted to ask if you know anyone who's currently looking for a co-founder or also exploring new ideas. Here is a blurb you could forward: -- I (Moritz Wallawitsch) previously co-founded http://BenchFlow.ai (backed by Jeff Dean), http://RemNote.com (GC-backed, $2M ARR), and plan to build a new startup in b2b or prosumer saas. I'm interested in connecting with other technical founders who are in a similar situation. (http://moritzw.com)
