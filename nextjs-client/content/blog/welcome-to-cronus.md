# Welcome to Cronus: Redefining Productivity Tracking

Traditional time trackers tell you _what_ you did, but Cronus tells you _why_ it matters. We're building the future of productivity tracking—one that understands your goals and helps you stay aligned with what truly drives your success.

## The Problem with Current Solutions

Most productivity tools fall into two camps:

- **Time trackers** that require manual input and give you spreadsheets of data
- **Website blockers** that use rigid rules and treat all distractions equally

Both approaches miss the point: productivity isn't about perfect time allocation—it's about meaningful progress toward your goals.

## Our Solution: Goal-Aware Intelligence

Cronus automatically tracks your digital activity and uses AI to understand whether your current focus aligns with your stated goals. Instead of blocking everything or tracking everything, we provide intelligent nudges when you're drifting off course.

### Key Features

- **Passive Tracking**: No manual timers or category selection
- **Goal Awareness**: Understanding the _why_ behind your activities
- **Smart Nudges**: Gentle redirects when you're getting distracted
- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on your device

## The Vision

We believe the best productivity tool is one you forget you're using—until it gently guides you back on track. Cronus works in the background, learning your patterns and helping you build sustainable focus habits.
