# What We Learned about time tracking from Elon Musk and 5 successful CEOs

Time is the only resource you _can’t_ raise a round for. If you’re building, coding, or shipping, every hour counts — yet most of us have no idea where our time actually goes.

Here’s a curated list of the best recent (and timeless) resources on time tracking and productivity — for tech founders, PMs, and engineers. We’ll mix advice from billionaires, a Founding Father, and a few modern productivity nerds.

## 1. Rahul Vohra (Superhuman) on Focus and Meditation

[Watch here (18:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0igjSRZyX-w&t=1086s)

Superhuman’s CEO swears that **Transcendental Meditation** was the ultimate productivity hack: twice a day, 20 minutes each, and suddenly he could focus _way_ longer, think clearer, and actually ship.  
His takeaway? Sometimes the best time management tool isn’t a new app — it’s training your brain to _stay calm when everything’s on fire_.

## 2. Benjamin Franklin’s Original Time Tracker

[Read our blog](https://cronushq.com/blog/benjamin-franklin-on-time-tracking)

Franklin literally logged _every hour_ of his day by hand — asking himself each morning, _“What good shall I do today?”_ and each evening, _“What good have I done today?”_  
His meticulous habit revealed his flaws (he said he was “much fuller of faults” than he realized) but also helped him systematically improve.

Franklin didn’t have AI. You do. (Tools like [Cronus](https://cronushq.com) automate this so you don’t need a quill and ledger.)

## 3. Elon Musk’s 5-Minute Time Blocks

[Read Mayo Oshin’s post](https://www.mayooshin.com/time-blocking-elon-musk-manage-time)

Musk schedules his day in **five-minute chunks**. Emails, calls, quick meals — all pre-planned.  
The trick? It forces ruthless focus and prevents Parkinson’s Law (“work expands to fill the time available”) from turning your afternoon into sludge.

It’s extreme, but for anyone juggling multiple projects, it’s a reminder: **structure = freedom**.

## 4. A Software Engineer’s “Calendar Audit” at Khan Academy

[Read Oliver Northwood’s post](https://blog.khanacademy.org/a-case-for-time-tracking-data-driven-time-management/)

Oliver Northwood, a Khan Academy engineer, logged _everything_ he did in Google Calendar. The result:

- Killed his impostor syndrome
- Boosted his output
- Got promoted to tech lead

Why? Because he finally saw where his hours went — and what to fix (hint: too much Slack, too many meetings).

## 5. Paul Graham’s _Maker vs. Manager_ Schedule

[Read the essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

Still the gold standard for tech scheduling wisdom. Graham explains why one random meeting can nuke an entire afternoon for developers (the “maker’s schedule”) and why managers need structured hours.

If you’re coding or building, protect your **deep work blocks**. Do meetings later. Your brain (and your commits) will thank you.

## 6. Sam Corcos (Levels CEO) on Ruthless Time Auditing

[Read the 2-year analysis](https://review.firstround.com/an-exact-breakdown-of-how-one-ceo-spent-his-first-two-years-of-company-building/) | [Read the 5-year update](https://review.firstround.com/how-i-spent-17784-hours-in-5-years-as-a-startup-founder/)

Levels CEO Sam Corcos began tracking his time after a horrifying discovery: he was spending over **3 hours a day** on social media and news, not the 20 minutes he’d guessed. This is the kind of time blindness that automated tools like [Cronus](https://cronushq.com) are built to expose.

His meticulous tracking led to a few radical principles:

- **Ditch rote 1:1s:** Corcos scaled his direct reports from 6 to 20 without increasing his management time. How? He deleted all recurring 1:1s. Instead, each report uses a "living document" (on Notion) to flag issues. They only meet when a decision is needed to unblock them.

He also tracked how his dating life impacted his working hours:

- **Use your calendar as your _only_ to-do list:** If a task isn't blocked out on the calendar, it doesn't exist. This forces ruthless realism and kills the anxiety of an ever-growing to-do list.
- **Your main job is to unblock others:** He sees his role as an "information router." He spends 3-4 hours on email daily just to keep the team moving at peak efficiency.

His system isn’t just about logging hours; it’s about ruthlessly aligning every available minute with the company’s top priorities.

## 7. Bill Trenchard (First Round) on Getting 70% of Your Time Back

[Read the First Round Review article](https://review.firstround.com/70-of-time-could-be-used-better-how-the-best-ceos-get-the-most-out-of-every-day/?)

First Round partner Bill Trenchard argues that a staggering **70% of a CEO's time is spent sub-optimally**. After interviewing top CEOs, he compiled a list of high-leverage tactics to reclaim those hours.

- **Kill Status Meetings:** Trenchard's most radical tip? Get rid of the round-robin status update meeting. Instead, have team members write their updates in a shared document (like a Google Doc) for everyone to read weekly. This saves dozens of hours.
- **Become an Email Ninja (with the 2-Minute Rule):** If an email takes less than two minutes to answer, do it immediately. If it takes longer, move it to a task manager (like Asana or Todoist). This prevents your inbox from becoming a default to-do list. He also recommends tools like `SaneBox` to filter noise and `TextExpander` for canned responses.
- **De-risk Failure for Your Team:** A key role of a leader is to unblock their team. Trenchard advises asking, "What is the cost of failure?" If the cost is low, empower the team to move fast and break things. Don't let perfectionism on a minor feature grind a major project to a halt. This is the 80/20 rule in action.

## 8. John Lees-Miller (Overleaf CTO) on a Year of Minute-by-Minute Tracking

[Read the Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12388604)

Overleaf's co-founder and CTO, John Lees-Miller, manually tracked his time for over a year. His data-driven analysis offers some of the most concrete insights available for technical founders.

- **The Myth of the 130-Hour Work Week:** Lees-Miller logged a rigorous 52 hours of _actual_ work per week. He notes that this was a strict definition—any small break stopped the clock. It's a realistic look at the "marathon" of building a startup.
- **Management Explodes, Meetings Disappear:** As his dev team grew by 200%, his `management` time skyrocketed by 230%. But surprisingly, his time in scheduled `meetings` _decreased_ by 72%. Why? Most of his new management tasks (like code reviews) were asynchronous, happening on GitHub and chat.
- **The Weekend Creep:** The most alarming discovery was where his dev time went. While his total coding time stayed the same, it shifted. Workday `dev` time fell by 40%, but was replaced by a 140% _increase_ in weekend coding. A cautionary tale for any hands-on founder.

## Why This Matters (and Why Cronus Exists)

Time tracking isn’t about obsessing over minutes — it’s about **awareness**. Every resource above shares the same message: when you know where your time goes, you can _actually_ do something about it.

That’s why we built [**Cronus**](https://cronushq.com):

- **AI-driven tracking** — automatically logs apps, sites, and context
- Separates _productive_ vs. _distracting_ time (it knows the difference between a work YouTube tutorial and a cat video)
- Zero manual logging

Because Ben Franklin didn’t have an AI assistant. You do.
