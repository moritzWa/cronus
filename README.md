# whatdidyougetdonetoday

A modern SaaS template with authentication, payments, and a beautiful UI. This template was originally built as an AI-powered spreadsheet tool, which is why you might notice some table-related naming conventions in the codebase.

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies

- üöÄ **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- üîÑ **Monorepo Structure** with workspaces (client, server, shared)
- üì± **React** + **TypeScript** for the frontend
- üé® **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn UI** for styling
- üîê **tRPC** for type-safe API calls
- üí≥ **Stripe** for payments
- üìä **MongoDB** for database

### Key Libraries

- **Craco** - Used for customizing Create React App configuration without ejecting
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **React Query** - Data fetching and caching
- **Zod** - Schema validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun (latest version)
- MongoDB
- Stripe account
- Google OAuth credentials

### Environment Variables

Contact the project maintainer to get the required environment variables. You'll need to set up:

- MongoDB connection string
- Stripe API keys
- Google OAuth credentials
- Other service-specific keys

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatdidyougetdonetoday-ai.git
cd whatdidyougetdonetoday-ai
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

3. Start the development servers

For the frontend (in the client directory):

```bash
cd client
bun dev
```

For the backend (in the server directory):

```bash
cd server
bun dev
```

### Running the Server and Electron App Together

To run both the backend server and the Electron application concurrently for development:

```bash
bun run dev:electron-server
```

## Monorepo Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure with three main packages:

### Client (`/client`)

- Built with Create React App + Craco
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements Shadcn UI components
- Handles all frontend logic and UI

### Server (`/server`)

- Bun-based backend
- tRPC for type-safe API endpoints
- MongoDB integration
- Handles authentication and payments

### Shared (`/shared`)

- Contains shared TypeScript types
- Used by both client and server
- Ensures type safety across the stack

### Electron App (`/electron-app`)

- A desktop application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript.
- Provides a native desktop experience.
- For more details, see the [Electron App README](./electron-app/README.md).

## Deployment

The application is set up as a monorepo with separate client and server packages:

- Nextjs Client: Deploy the `nextjs-client` directory to a static hosting service
- Admin Client: Deploy the `client` directory to a static hosting service
- Backend: Deploy the `server` directory to a Node.js hosting service

## Deployment on Render

This project is set up for easy deployment on [Render](https://render.com/). Below are the recommended settings for both the client and server services.

### Client (Static Site)

- **Root Directory:** `client`
- **Publish Directory:** `client/build`
- **Build Command:**

  ```sh
  cd client && bun install && bun add -d @craco/craco ajv ajv-keywords && bun run build
  ```

  This command installs dependencies, ensures required build tools are present, and builds the React app.

- **Redirect and Rewrite Rules:**
  To support client-side routing (React Router), add the following rule:

  | Source | Destination | Action  |
  | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
  | /\*    | /index.html | Rewrite |

  This ensures all routes are handled by your React app.

### Server (Web Service)

- **Root Directory:** `server`
- **Build Command:**
  ```sh
  bun install && bun run build
  ```
- **Start Command:**
  ```sh
  bun start
  ```

> **Note:**
> The previous project was called "deeptable" (as seen in the screenshots), so you may see references to that name in Render or in some configuration files. You can safely update these to your new project name.

## Building and Running the Electron App

The Electron app uses [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) for packaging and distribution. For detailed instructions on building, code signing, and publishing new releases, please refer to the dedicated README in the Electron app directory:

[**‚û°Ô∏è Electron App Build and Release Guide (`electron-app/README.md`)**](./electron-app/README.md)

This guide covers:

- Development builds
- Production builds (signed `.app` and `.dmg`)
- Code signing setup
- Publishing releases with OTA updates to S3

## Debugging

### Viewing Logs on macOS

The native Objective-C modules use Apple's Unified Logging system (`os_log`). To view these logs for debugging purposes:

1. Open the **Console.app** on macOS.
2. Start the Cronus application.
3. In the search bar of the Console app, enter the following filter and press Enter:
   `    subsystem:com.cronus.app`
   This will display all log messages generated by the native modules, which is essential for diagnosing issues related to window tracking and native code execution.
